# scraping-challenge
- Please note that this repo is for the Module 11 Challenge. There was no specified naming of the repo in the homework instructions.
- There are 3 files in the repo, two jupyter notebooks and one csv file, in addition to this Read.me. Example output was provided for some of the questions in the provided jupyter notebooks. My goal was to write code to match these output cells. All work was performed by myself.
